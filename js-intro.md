# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is something that we can give data to and ask to give back a certain result based on that data. For example we can give it the array [1, "a", 2, "b", 3, "c"] and ask our function to return a new array with only the  numeric values within the original array.

  Researched answer: A function is a set of statements that calculate a value. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value.


2. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer: 
  .push : adds a value onto the end of an array
  .concat : combines multiple arrays into one
  .shift : adds a value to the begginging of an array
  .unshift : removes a value from the beggining of an array
  .sort : alphebetizes values in an array
  

  Researched answer:
  .push : adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
  .concat : used to merge two or more arrays. This method does not change the existing arrays, but instead returns a new array.
  .shift : removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array.
  .unshift : adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
  .sort : removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array.



3. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: 
  console.log() is used to print the result of our code in the terminal.
  return is used to manipulate the data we input.

  Researched answer:
  console.log outputs a message to the web console. The message may be a single string, or it may be any one or more JavaScript objects.
  Return ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer:
  An argument is the data we are passing through the function. A variable is a way of naming our data so we can easily access it.

  Researched answer:
  A variable can changed and be reassigned, whereas an argument should remain constant throughout the function.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
  With pair programming, you have someone driving (writing the code) while the other person is there to make suggestions and help spot errors.

  Researched answer:
  The expected benefits of pair programming are increased code quality, opportunity for junior developers to learn techniques from more experienced developers, amoung many other benefits.


6. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer: JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to talk to our computer. It is a language that is sort of a bridge between English and binary code (our computer's root language).


7. What is one thing we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: The opportunity to work through a lot of challenges with guidance from each topic was very helpful.
